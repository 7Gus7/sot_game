August ‎2022 - Present

This is currently a work in progress which is to eventually become a full-sized game made in Unity.
- Collaborating with a partner in developing this project, as well as using git version control, which versed me in teamwork and communication for these types of projects

- Imported custom sprites made by my partner and used Unity’s built-in tools to give them properties

- Programmed using C# in Visual Studio Code to make movement controls that can be easily modified, acquainting me with how to learn new softwares on the fly
